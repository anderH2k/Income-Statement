# Income Statement Analysis Dashboard Project

## Description
The Income Statement Project in Power BI, built using a dummy bank dataset, includes multiple dashboard pages that centralize financial metrics. This tool enables the finance and accounting team to analyze income, expenses, and profit margins, providing data-driven insights into profitability and operational efficiency.

## Situation
The finance team faced a challenge in consolidating and analyzing income statement data across multiple branches and regions. Fragmented data hindered visibility into key financial metrics, making it difficult to:

- Monitor net income, income, and expenses month-by-month, impacting financial forecasting.
- Examine the distribution of interest and operating income as well as expenses, affecting strategic cost management.
- Assess metrics like net profit margin, operating margin, operating efficiency, and the income coverage ratio (ICR) to ensure financial stability.
- Evaluate branch-specific performance to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.
- Transform financial indicators into actionable insights to drive cost reduction, revenue optimization, and profitability.

## Task
As the data analyst for this project, I consolidated and analyzed income statement data from a dummy bank dataset using Power BI. The goal was to create a multi-page, interactive dashboard that visualizes financial metrics across branches and regions, providing the finance team with actionable insights to support decision-making, optimize profitability, and improve operational efficiency.

## Action

### Data Preparation and Cleaning
The first step was importing raw data for the first month into Power BI, followed by a thorough cleaning and transformation process to ensure accuracy and consistency:

- **Data Validation**: Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, corrected errors, and handled missing data.
- **Data Transformation**: Reshaped data to align with analysis requirements.
- **Data Enrichment**: Added relevant data, such as economic indicators or industry benchmarks.

### Data Modeling
I designed a data model using a star schema for efficient analysis and visualization:

- **Fact Table**: Contains core numerical measures (revenue, expenses, and profit).
- **Dimension Tables**: Provide context, including time, geography, product category, and customer demographics.

This model established clear relationships, enabling flexible analysis.

### Data Visualization and Insights
Using Power BI, I developed a comprehensive dashboard that includes:

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Engaging charts and graphs for a concise overview of performance.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Tracking metrics like net income, return on equity, and loan growth.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends in KPIs over time.
- **Drill-Down Capabilities**: Allowing users to explore data in detail.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Enabling users to tailor the dashboard to their needs.

## Main Dashboard
The main dashboard provides a visual overview of the financial performance, highlighting key insights and trends across different branches and regions.

## Key Takeaways After Analysis
- The bank has demonstrated strong financial performance, with healthy net income and profit margins.
- Revenue growth is consistent, and cost control measures effectively maintain profitability.
- An upward trend in net income indicates positive business momentum.
- Interest income is a significant contributor to total income, with operating income also playing a vital role.
- Monitoring expenses is essential, particularly during months with higher expenditure.
- One branch shows a loss, with expenses exceeding income, impacting net profit.

## Recommendations
- **Maintain Interest Income Momentum**: Focus on loan growth and effective interest rate management.
- **Identify and Reduce Key Expense Drivers**: Prioritize cost-cutting in areas like salaries, marketing, and technology.
- **Optimize Branch Network**: Assess each branch's performance, considering consolidation or closure for underperforming branches.
- **Investigate Loss in Yangon**: Conduct a detailed analysis to find the root causes and take corrective actions.
- **Geographical Focus**: Emphasize growth in profitable regions and work to improve performance in underperforming regions.
